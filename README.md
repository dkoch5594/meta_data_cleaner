Meta (Facebook/Instagram) very helpfully lets you download a copy of all of the data they have on you. They even let you specify the date range for the data you want, but unfortunately they don't apply the time filter to everything. This would be fine, except some people are being asked to turn over the data as part of a legal proceeding. You should never have to give the opposing legal team more information than they explicitly asked for. That's where Meta Data Cleaner (MDC) comes in. MDC removes content from your Meta Data archive and then packages up only what you want so you can pass it on.
